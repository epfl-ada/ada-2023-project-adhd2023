# Hack IMDb rating

## Abstract

Amidst the ever-evolving landscape of the global film industry, understanding the factors that lead to a film's success has become crucial. With millions of viewers relying on film ratings to guide their viewing choices, it's essential to delve into what drives these ratings. This project aims to reveal the parameters that significantly influence a film's rating, utilizing the extensive IMDb database as its primary resource. While conventional factors and directorial prowess are often highlighted, our study seeks to uncover the subtler, yet pivotal elements that contribute to a film's acclaim, by employing a comprehensive analytical approach, and by dissecting various components. The goal is to not only understand the visible layers of what makes a film favorable but also to identify the underlying factors often overlooked. This research could serve as a vital tool for filmmakers, critics, and enthusiasts alike, providing insights into the anatomy of highly rated movies.

## Research questions
Our analysis will put the light on the movie Rating The research questions that we would like to answer falls into three domains: 
1) What are the parameters contributing to a movie success and how interpretate them.
2) Does real world event related movie, are more likely to achieve great success.
3) Is it possible to create a model in order to predict movie rating using the relevent and spotted parameters


## Additional datasets
•**IMDb Rating Dataset**:
Our analysis integrates the IMDb rating dataset taken from [IMDb Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com). This dataset comprises two CSV files:
- *rating_id.csv:* Contains IMDb rating data.
- *name_id.csv:* Includes additional information about the movies (name, type, ...).

•**Events Dataset**:
Supplementary data, generated by ChatGPT, is included in the analysis. This dataset captures the most significant events from 1820 to 2014 and is created using the code found in `generate_events.py`.

•**Oscar Dataset**:
This dataset is a collection of data from The Academy Awards Database, containing the winners and nominees of the Oscars from 1927 to 2023. it is taken from [kaggle Oscars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award) 

## Methods

### 
### T-tests :

### Linear regression :

## Executed timeline

### Step 1: Data Pre-Processing 

•**Movie Metadata**

For our goal, the data was almost clean, we only removed some outliers.

•**Movie Plot Summaries**

Matching algorithm are highly sensitive to outliers in text and our data included undesired words to describe the type of the plot but the were all between brackets so we proceeded to remove them.

•**IMDB Data**

This data included tvshows, short movies and other non significant types of movies so we proceeded to remove them by merging with our movie_metadata based on the movie_name and start_year and filtered the movies who had less than 200 reviews since we agreed that they weren't significant in our analysis. 

### Step 2: Analysing Metadata Factors 

The movies metadata helped us draw several helpful conclusions about how to increase the IMDb rating of movies: 

**•Language Factor**

When analysing for the factor of languages present in a film, we compared the rating means, accounting for a 95% confidence interval. Further we ran a Mann-Whitney-U test on the movies associated to popular languages and analysed the p-values observed.

•**Era Factor**

•**Number Of Votes Factor**

•**Production Country Factor**

•**Movie Runtime Factor**


### Step 3: Analysing Plot Factors

The plot of a movie can be a significant factor in determining both its high and low rankings so we dedicated a lot of analysis to reveal how a movie can take advantage of it to climb the IMDb ranking ladder 

•**Real Stories Effect**

We used BERT to

•**Plot Ending Effect**


### Step 4: Predicting IMDb rating

•**Logistic Regression**

We will train a logistic_regression model to fit our analysed data and test it on a similar data after 2016 to see if given the previously stated factors, we can predit its IMDb rating.
